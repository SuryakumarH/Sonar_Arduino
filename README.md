# Sonar_Arduino
Abstract
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time sonar system using an Arduino R4 WiFi microcontroller. A servo motor is employed to rotate an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor across a range of angles, allowing the system to measure distances to obstacles in the environment. The distance data is transmitted via serial communication and visualized using Processing software, providing a graphical representation of the surrounding area. This project showcases the use of Arduino in building a cost-effective and accurate sonar system for object detection and mapping.
